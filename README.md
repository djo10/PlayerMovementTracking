# Player movement tracking
The project presents the system for tracking the movement of players in the video of the football match. Neural network classifies players based on the numbers in their picture. Then, k-means algorithm is applied to clusterize the players in two teams. Application output is the heatmap representing the movement of the individual players and average formation of each team.
